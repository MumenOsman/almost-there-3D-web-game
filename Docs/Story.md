# Story & World
Inspired by Alice in Wonderland, this world is playful, oversized, and slightly whimsical, as if a child shrunk and wandered into a giant, familiar house. Every table is a mountain, every chair a tower, and even the smallest objects feel alive. The world is soft, colorful, and gently exaggerated like stepping inside a storybook.

You play the Rabbit. Your days are full of small missions of curiosity and exploration, like hopping from countertop to countertop or discovering a carrot hidden under a teacup. Each jump, each careful landing, is an accomplishment in itself.

As you explore, you slowly sense the larger whimsical world outside the immediate kitchen, hinted through playful environmental storytelling: a soft glow beyond a window, a breeze that ruffles oversized curtains, or distant sounds of teapots tinkling and tiny bells ringing. You begin to realize that this cozy kitchen is just one part of a much bigger world, waiting to be discovered in future adventures.

There is no fail state, no dark ending. Instead, the story exists in moments of wonder, discovery, and gentle triumph. Falling off a table isn’t a failure — it’s a small bounce, a reminder that curiosity and experimentation are celebrated here. The story grows organically through the player’s interactions, giving meaning to simple mechanics: jumping, collecting carrots, exploring hidden paths, and interacting with objects that respond warmly to your actions.
