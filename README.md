#  Almost There

Hop into a cozy 3D parkour adventure! Play as a curious rabbit exploring a familiar, oversized world. Leap across platforms, discover hidden paths, and collect carrots at your own pace. This game was **designed and developed with AI** to create a thoughtful, relaxing experience.

## Gameplay
- Parkour-based movement (jump, dash, bounce)
- Collect carrots to progress through cozy micro-missions
- Hand-crafted level design with multiple routes to explore
- No fail states, designed for flow and relaxation

## How AI Shaped This Game

AI was central to developing "Almost There":
- **Game Design:** Claude helped conceptualize core mechanics and level design philosophy
- **Character & Environment:** DALL-E inspired visual direction and aesthetic
- **Level Architecture:** AI analysis informed optimal difficulty curves and carrot placement strategies
- **Design Philosophy:** Gemini helped define what makes a cozy, accessible game experience

The game is **built on AI-informed design**, not just as a showcase, but as a practical tool for better game development.

## Art Direction
- Soft, toy-like proportions
- Pastel colors and warm lighting

- No gameplay delays

## How AI Made This Better

The development process relied heavily on AI:
1. **Game Concept** - Claude explored game mechanics and theme options
2. **Level Design** - AI analysis provided insights into optimal challenge progression
3. **Visual Direction** - DALL-E and design AI inspired the aesthetic and art style
4. **Difficulty Tuning** - AI-informed strategies for balancing challenge and accessibility
5. **Code Architecture** - AI helped structure the codebase efficiently

This isn't meant to be a gimmick - these tools were essential to shipping a complete, polished game on a tight hackathon schedule.
