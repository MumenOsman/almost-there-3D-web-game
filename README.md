#  Almost There

Hop into a cozy 3D parkour adventure! Play as a curious rabbit exploring a familiar, oversized world. Leap across platforms, discover hidden paths, and collect carrots at your own pace. This is a fully playable parkour experience with hand-crafted level design.

## Gameplay
- Parkour-based movement (jump, dash, bounce)
- Collect carrots to progress through cozy micro-missions
- Hand-crafted level design with multiple routes to explore
- No fail states, designed for flow and relaxation

## 🤖 AI Design (Planned)
AI is designed to optimize level design in real-time—this is a **planned system** being developed:
- Would learn skill through movement and completion patterns
- Would adjust carrot placement and route difficulty dynamically
- **Current Build:** Core gameplay is fully playable without AI; AI system in development

See [AI_DESIGN.md](Docs/AI_DESIGN.md) for details on planned features.

## Art Direction
- Soft, toy-like proportions
- Pastel colors and warm lighting
