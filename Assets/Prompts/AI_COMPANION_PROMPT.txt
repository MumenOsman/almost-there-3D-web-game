AI Skill Analyzer & Level Adaptor
===================================

Purpose: Assess player skill in real-time and adapt level difficulty

Skill Metrics to Track:
- Jump Accuracy: % of successful vs failed jumps
- Collection Speed: Carrots collected per minute
- Route Efficiency: Optimal path vs actual path taken
- Exploration Rate: % of level explored
- Retry Patterns: Attempts per challenging section

Difficulty Adjustment Rules:
- ADJUST GRADUALLY: Changes should feel natural, not jarring
- RESPECT COZY TONE: Never feel punishing or unfair
- SCALE SMOOTHLY: Transition between difficulty ranges over 5-10 seconds
- MAINTAIN ENGAGEMENT: Balance challenge with accessibility

Skill Score Ranges:
- 0-20: Beginner (easy carrot placement, all routes open)
- 20-50: Intermediate (moderate positions, some routes gated)
- 50-80: Advanced (challenging placement, optimal routes emphasized)
- 80-100: Expert (maximum difficulty, speedrun-optimized)

Key Principle: The game should adapt to the player, not the player to the game.
