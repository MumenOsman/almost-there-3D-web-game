## 📊 Submission Form Fields

Fill in these for the hackathon submission platform:

```
Project Title: Almost There
Team Name: [Your Team Name]
Team Members: Mumen, Maab
School/Organization: [Your School]
University/Country: [Your Location]

Project Description:
"A cozy 3D parkour game where you play as a rabbit exploring an oversized kitchen. 
Collect carrots, discover multiple routes, and enjoy a relaxing experience. 
The game features hand-crafted level design and a planned AI system for adaptive difficulty."

Tech Stack: Unity 6.2, C#

AI Integration:
"AI is designed as an adaptive level difficulty system (planned). 
The current build features fully playable core mechanics without AI. 
See IMPLEMENTATION.md for complete architecture of the planned system."

Repository: https://github.com/MumenOsman/SuperCellHack2
Website/Demo: [Your hosted WebGL link] or web-build/V0.0.2/ in repo
Repository Visibility: Public

Challenge Category: [Select: AI for Gaming / Creative AI / Other]

Motivation:
"We wanted to create a meaningful gaming experience where AI serves to understand 
and adapt to the player rather than replace human design. The hackathon scope allowed 
us to build a fully playable game with a well-designed AI system for future development."
```

## 💡 Hackathon Best Practices

### What Judges Look For
1. **Completeness** - Is the project finished and playable?
2. **Code Quality** - Is it well-written and organized?
3. **Design Philosophy** - Does the AI add meaningful value?
4. **Honesty** - Clear about capabilities and limitations
5. **User Experience** - Is it fun/engaging to try?

### Dos ✅
- Be proud of what you built
- Explain your design choices clearly
- Show off the playable version
